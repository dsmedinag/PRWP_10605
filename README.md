The code in this replication package constructs the analysis file from the Great Integrated Household Survey (GEIH, Spanish acronyms) using Stata 15. The do-files run all of the code to generate the data for figures 1 to 34 and tables 2 to 5 in the paper. The replicator should expect the code to run for about 4 hours.

Because our work requires comparing results over time from 2015 to 2021 and using information from the Mission for the Splicing of the Employment, Poverty, and Inequality Series (MESEP) as a source for labor income variables, we use the 2005 frame GEIH data between 2015 and 2021. 

The full dataset and documentation of GEIH can be downloaded from [https://microdatos.dane.gov.co/index.php/catalog/MERCLAB-Microdatos]. We obtain the GEIH microdata for each year from the 'Mercado Laboral' collection. For example, to download the year 2015, the label with which the information is identified is 'Gran Encuesta Integrada de Hogares - GEIH - 2015'. 

In the same repository, you can find the full dataset and documentation of 'Medición de Pobreza Monetaria y Desigualdad' from the Mission for the Splicing of the Employment, Poverty, and Inequality Series (MESEP). It can be downloaded from [https://microdatos.dane.gov.co/index.php/catalog/POBCONVID]. We obtain the microdata for each year from the 'Pobreza y Condiciones de Vida' collection. For example, to download the year 2015, the label with which the information is identified is 'Medición de Pobreza Monetaria y Desigualdad - 2015'.
