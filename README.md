The code in this replication package constructs the analysis file from the Great Integrated Household Survey (GEIH, Spanish acronyms) using Stata 15. The do-files run all of the code to generate the data for figures 1 to 34 and tables 2 to 5 in the paper. The replicator should expect the code to run for about 4 hours.

The full dataset and documentation of GEIH can be downloaded from [https://microdatos.dane.gov.co/index.php/catalog/MERCLAB-Microdatos] . Because our work requires comparing results over time from 2015 to 2021 and using information from the Mission for the Splicing of the Employment, Poverty, and Inequality Series (MESEP) as a source for labor income variables, we use the 2005 frame GEIH data between 2015 and 2021.
