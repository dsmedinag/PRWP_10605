The code in this replication package constructs the analysis file from the Great Integrated Household Survey (GEIH, Spanish acronyms) using Stata 15. Two main files run all of the code to generate the data for the 15 figures and 3 tables in the paper. The replicator should expect the code to run for about 14 hours.
